Project Overview
This project was created for The Gaming Room, a client who currently runs Draw It or Lose It as an Android-only game. They wanted to take things to the next level by expanding it into a web-based game that works smoothly on desktops (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile devices.

The goal was to make the game scalable, secure, and fun to play across different platforms. It needed to handle multiple teams and players, ensure game and team names were unique, keep only one active game instance in memory, and protect all communication between players and the server.

Reflection
Who was the client and what did they need?
The Gaming Room wanted to make their Android game available on more devices without losing quality or performance. My task was to design the software in a way that made it flexible, reliable, and easy to scale as the player base grew.

What did I do well?
I think I did a good job making technical choices that tied directly to the client’s needs—and explaining them in plain language so both developers and non-technical stakeholders could follow along. The recommendations section is especially strong, covering everything from operating platform choices to security.

What was helpful about creating the design document?
Writing the design document first gave me a clear blueprint before touching any code. It forced me to think through architecture, storage, memory management, and security early, which meant fewer surprises later.

If I could revise one part, what would it be?
I’d add more detail and visuals to the domain model section. A richer diagram showing how all the parts fit together would make onboarding new developers easier.

How did I address the user’s needs?
I kept player experience at the center—fast load times, smooth gameplay, secure data handling, and no frustrating downtime. Designing with the end user in mind is key because it’s what makes them want to keep playing and recommending the game.

How did I approach the design, and what would I do next time?
I used an object-oriented approach with UML diagrams to map out the system. I also kept scalability and cross-platform compatibility in mind from the start. Next time, I’d add some early user testing into the design phase to validate ideas before development begins.
